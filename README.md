# NLuaMacDebug - Basic Repo for NLua Crash

This repo contains an extremely dumb interactive lua console concept. Write text into the console and it'll run the associated lua, until the "exit" command is written.

Toggle the `LuaEngine.CAUSE_CRASH` in program to have a case that breaks vs works just fine (the console header will write and it will accept input)
